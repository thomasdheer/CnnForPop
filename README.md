Repository containing all the code used in "Creating a Songwriting Tool Based on Convolutional Neural Networks and a Moving-Window Sampler",
a master's thesis written by Thomas D'heer for completing the Master of Artificial Intelligence at KU Leuven.

In this work, the Coconet model from Google's Magenta project was extended with various features,
including a data processing algorithm for MIDI-files and a moving-window sampler to create time-extended samples.

As the used pop music datasets are too large to upload on Github, they are not included here.
If you do not feel like training one, contact the author for a download link.
