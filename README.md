Repository containing all the code used in "Creating a Songwriting Tool Based on Convolutional Neural Networks and a Moving-Window Sampler",
a master's thesis written by Thomas D'heer for completing the Master of Artificial Intelligence at KU Leuven.

In this work, the Coconet model from Google's Magenta project was extended with various features,
including a data processing algorithm for MIDI-files and a moving-window sampler to create time-extended samples.
For more details, read the full text.

As the used pop music datasets and trained models are too large to upload on Github, they are not included here.
If you would like to obtain them, contact the author for a download link.

The original Coconet model which has been pre-trained on J.S. Bach chorales can be downloaded from here:
